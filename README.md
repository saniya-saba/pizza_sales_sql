# Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL Queries



## Description
This project involves analyzing pizza sales data using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights about sales trends, customer preferences, and operational performance. The analysis spans basic data retrieval, intermediate joins and aggregations, and advanced revenue analyses.


## Objectives
### Basic:
* Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
* Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
* Identify the highest-priced pizza.
* Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
* List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their      quantities.
### Intermediate:
* Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
* Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
  Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
* Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
* Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
### Advanced:
* Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
* Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
* Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.
